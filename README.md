Student Management System in CA lightweight, console-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built in C. This project demonstrates the use of structs, arrays, loops, and soft-deletion logic to manage student records efficiently.🚀 FeaturesAdd Student: Register new students with a unique auto-incrementing Roll Number.Display Records: View a list of all active student records.Soft Delete: Remove students by Roll Number using an active flag (preserves data integrity).Input Handling: Includes buffer clearing and string formatting to handle spaces in names.🛠️ How it WorksThe system uses a struct Student to organize data and a fixed-size array to store records.FieldDescriptionrnoUnique identifier (Auto-incremented)nameStudent's full name (up to 50 characters)stdThe class/standard of the studentmarksAcademic scoreactiveBoolean flag (1 for active, 0 for deleted)💻 Getting StartedPrerequisitesA C compiler (GCC, Clang, or MinGW)Terminal or Command PromptInstallation & ExecutionClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/student-management-system.git
